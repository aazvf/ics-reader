This entire project (including this readme) was generated using chat-gpt, I just pieced it all together.
This is a Rust learning exercise, coming from a PHP/JS developer.

# Rust ICS Reader

The Rust ICS Reader is a simple Rust program that extracts UK bank holidays from an iCalendar file and outputs them in JSON format.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To use this program, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't already have Rust installed, you can download and install it from the official Rust website at rust-lang.org.

## Installing
To install the Rust ICS Reader, you can simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aazvf/ics-reader.git
```

Once you've cloned the repository, you can build and run the program using Cargo:

```bash
cd rust-ics-reader
cargo run --release https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays/england-and-wales.ics
```

## Usage
The Rust ICS Reader requires one command line argument: the URL of the iCalendar file containing UK bank holidays.

```
cargo run --release <URL>
```

## Output

The Rust ICS Reader outputs UK bank holidays in JSON format. Each holiday is represented by a JSON object with the following fields:

- date_start: The start date of a multi-day holiday in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- date_end: The end date of a multi-day holiday in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- summary: A short summary of the holiday.

Here's an example of what the JSON output might look like:

```json
[
  {
    "date_start": "2023-04-14",
    "date_end": "2023-04-17",
    "summary": "Good Friday"
  },
  {
    "date_start": "2023-04-14",
    "date_end": "2023-04-17",
    "summary": "Easter Monday"
  },
]
```

# Questions and answers with chat-gpt


    The following is the questions I asked chat-gpt to help learn what the code is doing, coming from a PHP/JS developer unfamiliar with things like <> and Vec

----------

This Rust script is a command-line application that fetches UK holidays from a given URL and parses them using regular expressions and the chrono library. The resulting data is then serialized as JSON and printed to the console.

Here's a line-by-line breakdown of what's going on:

- The use statements import necessary libraries for the script to function.
- The struct definition creates a custom data structure called Holiday with three fields: date_start, date_end, and summary. The #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] attribute is used to automatically generate serialization and deserialization code for this struct.
- The main function is the entry point of the program. It first collects the command-line arguments and checks that at least one argument (the URL) was provided. If no URL is provided, it prints an error message and exits.
- The get function from the reqwest library is used to fetch the contents of the URL provided in the command-line argument. The ? operator is used to propagate any errors that occur during the request, which could happen if the URL is invalid or the server is unreachable.
- A regular expression is defined using the regex library to match the format of the UK holiday data. The regular expression captures the date start, date end, and summary fields of each holiday.
- The captures_iter method is used to iterate over all matches of the regular expression in the fetched data. For each match, the date start and date end are parsed using chrono and converted to a String in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The summary field is extracted directly from the regular expression match. A new Holiday instance is created with these fields and added to a Vec of holidays.
- The serde_json library is used to serialize the Vec of holidays as a pretty-printed JSON string.
- The JSON string is printed to the console.

Now, to answer the original question: why is it a good idea to create a struct? In Rust, creating a struct is a way to define a custom data type that represents a particular concept or entity in your program. By defining a Holiday struct with three fields (date_start, date_end, and summary), the code becomes more expressive and easier to understand. It also allows the #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] attribute to be used, which automatically generates code to serialize and deserialize instances of the Holiday struct as JSON. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code that the programmer has to write and ensures that the resulting JSON is valid and consistent.


# why is '#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]' useful if the 'serde_json' thing is used anyway for json?

The #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] attribute is used in this Rust script to automatically generate serialization and deserialization code for the Holiday struct. This means that instances of the Holiday struct can be easily converted to and from JSON without having to write any serialization or deserialization code manually.

The serde_json library is used in this script to actually perform the JSON serialization of the Holiday instances, but it relies on the generated serialization code from the #[derive(Serialize)] attribute to work correctly.

Using #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] is useful because it abstracts away the details of how the serialization and deserialization works, making the code simpler and more maintainable. It also ensures that the resulting JSON is valid and consistent with the definition of the Holiday struct. This is particularly useful when dealing with more complex data structures, as manually writing serialization and deserialization code can be error-prone and time-consuming.



# whats a Vec and why is it used, i dont get it

In Rust, a Vec is a dynamic array, which means it's an array that can grow or shrink in size as needed. It's similar to an ArrayList in Java or a std::vector in C++.

In this Rust script, a Vec is used to store a list of Holiday structs. This allows the program to fetch multiple holidays from the URL and store them in a convenient and flexible data structure. Without a Vec, the program would only be able to handle a fixed number of holidays, which would not be very useful in practice.

The Vec type is useful because it provides a number of convenient methods for working with collections of data, such as push to add new elements, pop to remove the last element, and iter to create an iterator over the elements. It's also possible to access individual elements using indexing (vec[i]) or with the get method (vec.get(i)).

In this script, the Vec is used to store a list of Holiday instances that are created by parsing data from the URL. The Vec is initialized to an empty vector (Vec::new()), and then new Holiday instances are created and added to the Vec using the push method. Finally, the Vec is serialized to JSON using the serde_json library and printed to the console.

Overall, the Vec type is a useful tool for working with collections of data in Rust, and it's particularly useful when the size of the collection is not known in advance or may change dynamically over time.


# what do the pipe characters around (|captures| mean

The pipe characters |captures| denote a closure or anonymous function in Rust.

In this script, the captures_iter method of the Regex type returns an iterator over Captures instances, which are produced by applying the regular expression to the uk_holidays string. For each Captures instance, the map method is called to create a new Holiday instance using the captured data.

The |captures| part of the code represents the closure that is passed as an argument to the map method. This closure takes a single argument, which is a reference to the current Captures instance, and produces a new Holiday instance using that data. The captures variable is the name given to the argument inside the closure.

The closure syntax in Rust allows you to define an anonymous function inline, without having to give it a separate name. The |captures| part of the code defines the argument(s) that the closure will take, and the code inside the braces {} defines the body of the function.

In this script, the closure takes a single argument, captures, and creates a new Holiday instance using the data from that argument. The resulting Holiday instance is returned by the closure and added to the Vec using the collect method.


# what does the &uk_holidays mean, where does the variable come from and what does the ampersand mean

In Rust, the & character before a variable name is used to create a reference to that variable. A reference is a way of accessing the data stored in a variable without taking ownership of that data. References are useful when you want to pass data to a function without copying it, or when you want to manipulate data in place without creating a new copy.

In this script, &uk_holidays creates a reference to the uk_holidays string that was fetched from the URL. The uk_holidays variable is defined earlier in the code, where it is assigned the result of calling the text method on the response from the get function:

```rust
let uk_holidays = get(&args[1])?.text()?;
```

This code sends an HTTP GET request to the URL provided as a command line argument, and then calls the text method to retrieve the body of the response as a string. The resulting string is stored in the uk_holidays variable.

Later in the code, the captures_iter method of the Regex type is called on the uk_holidays string reference to create an iterator over the Captures instances that match the regular expression:

```rust
let holidays: Vec<Holiday> = holiday_regex
        .captures_iter(&uk_holidays)
        .map(|captures| {
            // ...
        })
        .collect();
```

The &uk_holidays reference is passed as an argument to the captures_iter method to allow the method to access the data in the uk_holidays string without taking ownership of it. The captures_iter method uses the uk_holidays reference to iterate over the Captures instances in the string, and the closure passed to the map method uses the captures reference to access the captured data for each match.

Overall, the & character in Rust is used to create references to variables, which allows you to access the data stored in those variables without taking ownership of it. This is a powerful feature of Rust that allows you to write efficient and safe code that can manipulate data in place without creating unnecessary copies.


# what does the ?; mean

The ? character in Rust is called the "try operator". It is used to simplify error handling in Rust by automatically returning the Err variant of a Result if an error occurs, and propagating the error up the call stack. This can make Rust code more concise and easier to read.

When the try operator is used after a Result value, Rust checks whether the value is the Ok variant or the Err variant. If it is the Err variant, the ? operator will return the error immediately, unwrapping it from the Result and propagating it up the call stack.

The ; character in Rust is used to separate statements. In Rust, expressions can be used as statements by simply terminating them with a ; character. This allows you to perform an action without returning a value.

In the context of the Rust script you posted, the ? character is used after several method calls that return Result values, such as get(&args[1])?.text()? and serde_json::to_string_pretty(&holidays)?. These Result values are checked for errors using the ? operator, and if an error occurs, the error is immediately returned and propagated up the call stack.

The ; character is used at the end of some statements, such as eprintln!("Error: URL is a required parameter"); and println!("{}", pretty_holidays);. These statements do not return a value, so they are terminated with a ; character to indicate that they are complete statements.


# explain the 'println!("{}", pretty_holidays);' line, what are the alternative ways to do this? what does the {} mean? why is there a ! in the method name?

The println!("{}", pretty_holidays); line is using Rust's println! macro to print a formatted string to the console. The {} in the string is a placeholder for the value of the pretty_holidays variable, which will be printed in its place when the code is executed.

The println! macro is similar to the println function in other programming languages, but it allows you to format the string in various ways, such as by including variables or other values in the output.

There are several alternatives to using the println! macro to print formatted strings in Rust:

The print! macro can be used to print a formatted string without a newline character at the end.

The format! macro can be used to format a string and return the resulting string as a value, which can then be printed or used in other ways.

The write! macro can be used to write a formatted string to a buffer or other output stream, rather than printing it to the console.

The ! character in the macro name, such as println! and eprintln!, indicates that it is a macro rather than a regular function. Rust macros are similar to functions, but they operate on the syntax of the code rather than the values of variables or other runtime data.


# what do you mean by 'but they operate on the syntax of the code rather than the values of variables or other runtime data.'

In Rust, macros are a way to generate code that will be executed at compile-time, rather than at runtime. When you use a macro, the code you write is processed by the macro system before it is compiled, and the resulting code is then compiled and executed like any other Rust code.

Because macros operate on the syntax of the code, rather than the values of variables or other runtime data, they can be used to generate code that is more flexible and powerful than what can be achieved with regular functions alone. For example, macros can generate code that depends on the types of variables or other data, or that generates code dynamically based on other inputs.

This means that macros can be used to write code that is more concise, readable, and maintainable, as well as code that is more efficient and performant, since the code generated by a macro can be optimized by the Rust compiler just like any other Rust code.


# what does <> around things mean, fully breakdown this like explaining what everything does 'main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>'

In Rust, angle brackets (<>) are used to define type parameters for generic types and functions. A generic type or function can be used with different types, allowing you to write code that is more flexible and reusable.

In the example main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>, the angle brackets are used to define the return type of the main() function, which is a Result type with two type parameters. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the return type means:

- Result: This is a built-in Rust enum that represents the result of an operation that can fail. A Result value can either be Ok, indicating that the operation succeeded, or Err, indicating that an error occurred.
- <>: The angle brackets define the type parameters for the Result type. The first type parameter, (), indicates that the Ok variant of the Result type carries no value (i.e., it's an empty tuple). The second type parameter, Box<dyn std::error::Error>, indicates that the Err variant of the Result type carries an error value that implements the std::error::Error trait.
- ->: This arrow indicates the return type of the main() function.
- main(): This is the name of the function that is being defined.

So, putting it all together, main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> means that main() is a function that returns a Result type with two type parameters: an empty tuple (()) for the Ok variant, and a boxed dyn std::error::Error for the Err variant. The std::error::Error trait is a built-in trait in Rust that is implemented by types that represent errors. The Box type is used to box the error value, allowing it to be returned as a trait object.



# what does Box<dyn mean

In Rust, Box<dyn Trait> is a type that represents a boxed trait object. A trait is a collection of methods that can be implemented by any type, allowing different types to have a common interface. A trait object is a value that represents a reference to a type that implements a trait.

The dyn keyword in Box<dyn Trait> is a shorthand for "dynamic dispatch". It indicates that the trait methods will be dispatched dynamically at runtime, based on the concrete type of the value that the trait object points to. This is in contrast to "static dispatch", where the function to be called is determined at compile time based on the type of the value.

The Box type is used to allocate memory on the heap and store the trait object there, allowing it to be returned from a function or passed around as a value. The Box type is used because the size of the trait object is not known at compile time, and it may be too large to store on the stack.

So, Box<dyn std::error::Error> is a boxed trait object that represents an error value that implements the std::error::Error trait. The dyn keyword indicates that the methods of the Error trait will be dispatched dynamically at runtime, based on the concrete type of the error value. The Box type is used to store the trait object on the heap, allowing it to be returned from a function or passed around as a value.


# is Box like Vec? what others are there?

Box and Vec are both types that allocate memory on the heap in Rust, but they serve different purposes.

Box is used to allocate a single value on the heap and return a pointer to that value. The pointer is wrapped in a box, which is a smart pointer that automatically deallocates the memory when it goes out of scope. Box is typically used to allocate values of unknown size at compile time or to create a recursive data structure.

Vec, on the other hand, is used to allocate a contiguous block of memory on the heap and store a variable number of values of the same type in that block. Vec is useful for storing collections of values that can grow or shrink dynamically at runtime.

Other useful smart pointers in Rust include:

- Rc (reference counting) - a smart pointer that allows multiple references to the same value, tracking how many references there are and deallocating the value when the last reference goes out of scope.
- Arc (atomic reference counting) - a thread-safe version of Rc that can be safely shared between threads.
- Cell and RefCell - types that provide interior mutability, allowing you to mutate a value even if you only have a shared reference to it.
- Mutex and RwLock - synchronization primitives that allow you to safely share data between threads.

These smart pointers can help you manage memory and concurrency in your Rust code.


# can a Box go inside a Vec? list 10 more smart pointers and examples and reasons for using them in a table.

Yes, a Box can go inside a Vec. In fact, it's common to use a Vec<Box<T>> to store a variable number of heap-allocated values.

Here are 10 more smart pointers in Rust, along with examples and reasons for using them:

- Smart pointer	Example	Reason
- Pin	Pin<Box<T>>	Ensures that a value pointed to by a pointer doesn't move in memory. Useful for creating self-referential data structures.
- ManuallyDrop	ManuallyDrop<T>	Allows you to manually control the drop behavior of a value. Useful for working with values that have a destructor that needs to be bypassed or delayed.
- NonNull	NonNull<T>	Represents a non-null pointer to a value of type T. Useful for working with C APIs or other low-level code that requires non-null pointers.
- Cow	Cow<'a, str>	Represents a "borrowed" or "owned" version of a value, depending on the context. Useful for writing code that can work with both owned and borrowed data.
- LocalBox	LocalBox<T>	A heap-allocated value that doesn't require dynamic memory allocation. Useful for storing small values that need to be allocated on the heap, but don't need to grow or shrink at runtime.
- LocalKey	thread_local!(static FOO: LocalKey<MyStruct> = LocalKey::new());	A thread-local value that can be accessed from anywhere within a thread. Useful for storing per-thread state.
- NonNullPointer	NonNullPointer<T>	Represents a non-null raw pointer to a value of type T. Useful for working with low-level code that requires raw pointers.
- PhantomData	PhantomData<T>	A zero-sized type that represents a "phantom" reference to a type. Useful for implementing type-safe abstractions.
- BoxFuture	BoxFuture<'a, T>	A future that returns a value of type T, allocated on the heap. Useful for creating futures that can be passed between threads or stored in collections.
- MaybeUninit	MaybeUninit<T>	A type that represents an uninitialized value of type T. Useful for working with low-level code that requires uninitialized memory.

These smart pointers can help you write safe and efficient Rust code, and can simplify many common programming tasks.


# what is the equivalant of Vec<Box<T>> in php or javascript?

In PHP, there is no direct equivalent of Vec<Box<T>> since PHP is a dynamically typed language and does not have explicit types like Rust. However, you could use arrays or objects to achieve similar functionality.

In JavaScript, the equivalent of Vec<Box<T>> would be an array of objects. Since JavaScript is dynamically typed, you can store any type of object in an array, including other objects. For example:

```javascript
let myArray = [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 40 }
];
```

Here, myArray is an array of objects, each with a name and age property. You can add or remove objects from the array as needed, and access individual objects using their index in the array.


# try to give an example in php language, i still dont understand what a Box is or how it's different than a simple variable

In Rust, Box<T> is a smart pointer that provides ownership and memory management for heap-allocated values of type T. In other words, it is used to allocate memory on the heap and provide a reference to that memory.

In PHP, the equivalent of Box<T> would be the new keyword which is used to allocate memory on the heap and create a reference to that memory. Here's an example:

```php
class Person {
    public $name;
    public $age;

    function __construct($name, $age) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }
}


// Create a new instance of the Person class and store it in a variable
$person = new Person("John", 30);

// Create an array of Persons using the new keyword
$people = [
    new Person("Jane", 25),
    new Person("Bob", 40)
];
```

Here, we are using the new keyword to create a new instance of the Person class and store it in the $person variable. We are also using the new keyword to create an array of Person objects and store them in the $people array. This is similar to Vec<Box<T>> in Rust, where Box<T> is used to allocate memory on the heap and provide a reference to that memory, and Vec is used to store those references in an array.


# so can a Box be any type? i still dont get it

Yes, Box<T> can hold any type T that is valid in Rust. It is used to allocate memory on the heap and create a reference to that memory. The T in Box<T> specifies the type of value that the box is pointing to on the heap.

For example, Box<i32> would create a box that contains a single i32 value on the heap, while Box<String> would create a box that contains a String value on the heap.

Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    // create a new box containing an i32 value
    let my_box = Box::new(42);

    // create a new box containing a string value
    let my_string_box = Box::new(String::from("hello world"));
}
```

In this example, my_box is a box that contains an i32 value, and my_string_box is a box that contains a String value.


# what is T ???

In Rust, T is a generic type parameter that can represent any type. It is similar to using a variable in other programming languages to represent a value of any type.

When you see T in a Rust code, it means that the code is generic and can work with any type that implements the necessary traits. For example, if you have a function that takes a Box<T> as an argument, it can accept a box containing any type T as long as that type implements the Sized trait.

Here's an example of a generic function that takes a Box<T> as an argument:

```rust
fn print_boxed_value<T>(my_box: Box<T>) {
    println!("The value in the box is: {:?}", *my_box);
}
```

In this example, T is a generic type parameter that represents any type. The function takes a Box<T> as an argument and prints the value contained in the box. The * before my_box dereferences the box to get the value it contains.

You can call this function with any type that implements the Debug trait, like this:

```rust
let my_i32_box = Box::new(42);
let my_string_box = Box::new(String::from("hello world"));

print_boxed_value(my_i32_box);
print_boxed_value(my_string_box);
```

In this example, print_boxed_value is called twice, once with a Box<i32> and once with a Box<String>. The function works with both types because they both implement the Debug trait.


# so is Box the most common thing used? why use Box<t> instead of just <t> ?

No, Box<T> is not the most common smart pointer used in Rust. The most common smart pointer is the reference &T, which is used to borrow values without taking ownership of them.

Box<T> is used when you need to allocate a value on the heap, but you want to have ownership of that value. This is useful when the value needs to outlive the current scope, for example when returning a value from a function. Using Box<T> allows you to transfer ownership of the value to another part of the program.

You would use Box<T> instead of T when you need to allocate a value on the heap and have ownership of it. If you use T directly, the value would be allocated on the stack, and you would have to transfer ownership of the entire stack frame in order to transfer ownership of the value. This is not always desirable or possible. Using Box<T> allows you to allocate the value on the heap, and transfer ownership of the heap-allocated value, which is much more flexible.


# what do you mean by heap, stack, allocated, ownership, transfer. I only know php i dont know these words

In programming, the terms "heap" and "stack" refer to different regions of memory that are used for storing data.

The "stack" is a region of memory that is used for storing local variables and function call frames. When a function is called, its arguments and local variables are pushed onto the stack, and when the function returns, they are popped off the stack. The stack is a fixed-size data structure, and its size is determined at compile time.

The "heap" is a region of memory that is used for storing dynamically allocated data. Unlike the stack, the heap is a flexible data structure that can grow or shrink as needed at runtime. When you allocate memory on the heap, you use a special function called malloc or new (depending on the programming language) to request a block of memory of a certain size.

"Allocation" refers to the process of requesting and reserving a block of memory from the heap or stack for use by your program.

"Ownership" refers to which part of your program has the right to use a particular block of memory at any given time. In Rust, each block of memory has a single owner at any given time, and the owner has exclusive access to that memory.

"Transfer" refers to the process of transferring ownership of a block of memory from one part of your program to another. In Rust, when you transfer ownership of a value from one part of your program to another, the previous owner loses access to the value, and the new owner gains exclusive access to it. This is enforced by the Rust compiler, which prevents multiple parts of your program from accessing the same block of memory at the same time.


# would you ever actually transfer ownership? it seems all the rust examples use things like & to avoid taking or transfering ownership

Yes, transferring ownership can be useful in Rust in certain situations. Transferring ownership can be more efficient than creating a copy, especially for large objects like vectors or strings. Additionally, it can help ensure that resources are properly managed and not leaked. However, it's important to do it carefully and deliberately, as it can lead to issues like "use after free" errors if not done properly.

That being said, Rust provides other options like references (&) and borrowing, which allow you to access a value without transferring ownership. These options are useful when you want to pass a value to a function or method but still want to keep ownership of the original value. Additionally, they can help prevent data races and other types of memory errors. So, in many cases, references and borrowing may be preferred over transferring ownership.


## explain all the different magic types in order of most commonly used

In Rust, there are several types that are commonly referred to as "magic types", as they provide advanced functionality and features that make Rust such a powerful and safe language. Here are some of the most commonly used magic types in Rust:

- Vec<T> - a resizable, heap-allocated array that is one of the most commonly used data structures in Rust. It allows you to add, remove, and access elements in constant time.
- String - a heap-allocated, growable string type that is often used in Rust programs for text processing and manipulation. It provides many useful methods for working with strings, like concatenation, searching, and slicing.
- Box<T> - a pointer to a heap-allocated value of type T. It is used to allocate memory on the heap rather than the stack, and provides a way to transfer ownership of an object from one scope to another.
- Rc<T> - a reference-counted pointer to a value of type T. It allows multiple ownership of a value without copying it, and ensures that the value is dropped when all references to it are dropped.
- Arc<T> - an atomic reference-counted pointer to a value of type T. It is similar to Rc<T>, but provides thread-safe reference counting, making it suitable for use in concurrent programs.
- Cell<T> - a type that provides interior mutability, meaning that it allows you to mutate the value it contains even if it is immutable. This can be useful in cases where you need to mutate a value that is shared across multiple scopes.
- RefCell<T> - a type that provides dynamic borrowing and interior mutability. It allows you to borrow a value mutably or immutably, depending on the borrow rules, and ensures that the borrow is dropped when the value goes out of scope.
- Mutex<T> - a type that provides mutual exclusion, allowing multiple threads to access a shared value in a safe and synchronized way. It ensures that only one thread can access the value at a time, preventing race conditions and other synchronization issues.
- Arc<Mutex<T>> - a combination of the Arc and Mutex types, providing thread-safe reference counting and mutual exclusion for a shared value.

These are just a few of the many magic types available in Rust, each providing unique features and functionality to help you write safe and efficient code.
